On the backend, we will be maintaining an Excel file   with the following information:

 
Produit	Aire thérapeutique	Département	RMR adresse email	Backup adresse email
Product	Therapeutic Area	District	MSL email address	Backup email address
 
Requirement: We need to have hands-on to update the file as this occurs very often

@Amine : Please update the excel file with products  
If the HCP selects the product and keep the therapeutics area field empty, then the algo will search for the MSL and backup email addresses that match the product & district filled in by the HCP and send an email to them.
If the HCP selects the therapeutics area and keep the Product field empty, then the algo will search for the MSL and backup email addresses matching the therapeutic area & district selected by the HCP and for which the product field is empty and send an email to them.
If the HCP selects the product and therapeutics area, then the algo will search for the MSL and backup email addresses matching the product & district selected by the HCP and send an email to them.
