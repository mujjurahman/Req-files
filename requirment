Requirment :
On the backend, we will be maintaining an Excel file   with the following information:

Produit	Aire thérapeutique	Département	RMR adresse email	Backup adresse email
Product	Therapeutic Area	District	MSL email address	Backup email address
 
We need to have hands-on to update the file as this occurs very often

based on product and Therapeutic Area we will be triggering the mail.

Solution:

Create custom table using custom module
Add 5 columns to table as in csv
Create a route to call custom form to upload file
On Submit handler read csv and insert data into table and delete existing data (Use batch process to insert data in case of large dataset)
On email form query from table to get information to send it in email
trigger email
